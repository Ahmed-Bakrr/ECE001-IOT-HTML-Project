<li>Internet of things</li>

<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established.

Over 9 billion ‘Things’ (physical objects) are currently connected to the Internet, as of now. In the near future, this number is expected to rise to a whopping 20 billion.

There are four main components used in IoT:
</p>

<ol>
<li>LOW-POWER EMBBEDED SYSTEMS –
Less battery consumption, high performance are the inverse factors play a significant role during the design of electronic processes. </li>
<li>CLOUD COMPUTING –
Data collected through IoT devices is massivly big and this data has to be stored on a reliable storage server. This is where cloud computing comes into play. The data is processed and learned, giving more room for us to discover where things like electrical faults/errors are within the system.</li>
<li>AVAILABILLITY OF BIG DATA –
We know that IoT relies heavily on sensors, especially real-time. As these electronic devices spread throughout every field, their usage is going to trigger a massive flux of big data.</li>
<li>NETWORKING CONNECTION –
In order to communicate, internet connectivity is a must where every physical object is represented by an IP address. However, there are only a limited number of addresses available according to the IP naming. Due to the growing number of devices, this naming system will not be feasible anymore. Therefore, researchers are looking for another alternative naming system to represent each physical object. </li>

</ol>

<li>How IoT works</li>
<p>An IoT ecosystem contains web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors and communication hardware, to collect, send and act on data they need from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices -- for instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.

The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely rely on the specific IoT applications deployed.

IoT can also make use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to aid in making data collecting processes easy and more dynamic.</p>

<li>IoT benefits to organizations</li>
<p>The internet of things offers many benefits to organizations. Some benefits are industry-specific, and some are applicable across multiple industries. Some of the common benefits of IoT enable businesses to:</p>
<ol>
<li>monitor their overall business processes.</li>
<li>develop the customer experience (CX).</li>
<li>save time and money.</li>
<li>enhance employee productivity.</li>
<li>integrate and adapt business models.</li>
<li>make better business decisions.</li>
<li>generate more revenue.</li>
</ol>

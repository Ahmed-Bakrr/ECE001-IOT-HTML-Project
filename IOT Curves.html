<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has been a buzzword for a while now. It is now ready to turn from hype to reality. The IoT refers to the connected network of devices, vehicles, buildings, and other objects that allow the exchange, collection and analysis of data. Covering about 50 billion connected devices, the total value of IoT related business could hit $15 trillion by 2020.
